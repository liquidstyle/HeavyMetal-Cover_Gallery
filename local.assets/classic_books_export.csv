shm5620,Liberatore/Ranx Book Collection,"RANX by Liberatore and Tamburini - Three book masterpiece collection.  All three brutal volumes <br><b>PLUS</b> ""The Art of Liberatore<b>All four books available now for just $20.00 </b>including shipping within the USA, Canada and overseas shipping is $20.00<p>Introduction by Richard Corben<br>""It is my great pleasure to introduce this work by Tanino Liberatore and Stefano Tamburini. They have given us a mechanical creature with more passionate violence than any human character I have ever seen in the comic medium. </p><p>Ranxerox is a punk, futuristic Frankenstein, and with the under-aged Lubna, they are a bizarre Beauty and the Beast. This artist and writer team have turned a dark mirror to the depths of our Id and we see reflected the base part of ourselves that would take what it wants with no compromise, no apology - and woe to the person who would cross us. But it is all done with a black, wry, satyrical sense of humor. Since I feel a close kinship to Liberatore's art, I would like to scratch this surface first. Comic work is primarily a visual medium. It is the pictures, the page design, the graphic concert of the images, scenes, and characters that first attract the reader. Then the art must also be arranged in a conventional way to form a narrative. Some artists put more emphasis on the first task, attraction, while others work harder on the narrative and descriptive elements. </p><p>I believe I fall into this second category as do most of the comic artists I most admire. Our newest champion is Liberatore. Drawing apparently comes easily to this giant. His skill with anatomical forms is beautiful; yet he is not enslaved to this skill but uses it as a tool to further portray the characters. This guy can really draw flesh-and-blood people. He uses shaded, rounded forms -a rarity in comic art- and he does it with felt-tip markers! The ability to render soft edges with such a tool borders on the supernatural! Ranxerox and Lubna prowl a decayed urban setting with a seething mass of apathetic humanity. All this is rendered with rich textures in a chaotic but fitting color scheme. Ranxerox is a bizarre anti-hero in a twisted, distorted world. There is quite a lot of violence here. Ranx clobbers junkies, thugs, punks, and whole motorcycle gangs. Generally these are nasty characters who get what they deserve. We vicariously cheer Ranx on. But there are a couple of instances that might cause the reader to stop and think, even get angry for a moment: After a psychotic with a gun opens fire in a crowded train, killing several innocent bystanders, none of the survivors is concerned about the victims. And earlier, Ranx is irritated by a little girl selling flowers and he crushes her hand. Is this mindless peripheral violence? This may be an absurdly exaggerated joke about Italian flower girls. Perhaps Tamburini is saying, with Liberatore's help, that innocence has no hope for survival in such a world and the general population consists of automaton-like people who are more like machines than Ranxerox. </p><p>Finally, despite the artistic complexity, Ranxerox is not to be taken too seriously. Like Punch who threw his baby out the window and constantly beat Judy, Ranx is outrageous, but funny entertainment.""</p><p>--Richard Corben, June 1984</p>",Heavy Metal,Classic Book,"Classic Books, onsale",false,Variant,Default Title,,,,,"",0,shopify,0,deny,bandwear-fulfillment,6.00,20.00,true,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2358/6005/products/liberatore_set.jpg?v=1505679881,1,Liberatore/Ranx Book Collection,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2358/6005/products/liberatore_set.jpg?v=1505679881,lb,,

shm5616,"Hal Foster, Prince of Illustrators (VP)","A comprehensive biography of Hal Foster, in which author Brian M. Kane examines the 70-year career of one of the greatest illustrators of the 20th century. <p>""Superman"" was modelled after Foster's drawings of Tarzan, Flash Gordon's Alex Raymond borrowed compositions from ""Prince Valiant"", and many artists, including the famous contemporary Western painter James Bama, count Foster among their greatest influences. </p><p>Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1892 of a seafaring family, Hal naturally took to the sea. At the age of eight he paddled a 12-foot plank across Halifax Harbor to the consternation of large Cunard liners. In his youth he was a catalogue artist, a trapper, a professional boxer, a gold prospector, and a hunter-guide in the uncharted forests of Canada. In 1921 with a wife and two children to support he peddled his one-speed bicycle 1000 miles across dirt and gravel roads from Winnipeg to Chicago to attend the Art Institute and later find permanent employment. </p><p>The young illustrator's work appeared on the covers of ""Popular Mechanics"" and in hundreds of magazines for clients such as ""Northwest Paper"", ""Jekle Margarine"", ""Southern Pacific Railroad"" and ""Illinois Pacific Railroad"". In 1929 Foster illustrated the first newspaper adaptation of ""Tarzan of the Apes"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The comic strip was the first of its kind and it was Foster's sense of realism, composition, draftsmanship, and understanding of fluid anatomy that would forever mark him as ""The Father of the Adventure Strip"". The famous newspaper tycoon, William Randolph Hearst, wanted Foster and made the artist an unheard of offer. If Foster would leave Tarzan and come to work for Hearst's King Features Syndicate he could do anything he wanted and have complete ownership of the new series. The first episode of ""Prince Valiant in the Days of King Arthur"" appeared on 13 February 1937. </p><p>Foster's work has inspired generations of artists including Jack Kirby, Lou Fine, Frank Frazetta, Al Williamson, Wayne Boring, Joe Kubert, Russ Manning, Wally Wood, Dave Stevens, Carmine Infantino, Charles Vess, William Stout, John Buscema, Mark Schultz and the great Disney artist, Carl Barks.

As you watch this DVD it_s important to note Sorayama_s careful planning and composition of an image, his meticulous attention to the smallest details, his painstaking development of and continuous interaction with a painting, how he pays close attention to his reference, and his versatile use and array of mixed media. Sorayama approaches his paintings interactively. In other words, instead of simply executing a painting, he works methodically, allowing visual feedback to guide him as he progresses. He switches tools often as he gradually builds his surfaces, and he doesn't attempt to complete any one section in the first few passes, but rather starts light and gradually incorporates paint, ink, pencil, and airbrush until he_s satisfied. World renowned illustrator Dru Blair is your guide throughout Sorayama_s masterful rendering of an exotic pin-up. </p><p>To see more of Sorayama_s art, visit www.sorayama.net. <b>This DVD is published by Airbrush Action - Heavy Metal cannot ship this title.

shm3781,"Liberatore- Ranx <b>Collected #1, 2 & 3</b>","By Liberatore and Tamburini. <br>Three book masterpiece collection.  All three brutal volumes for just $29.95<br>AMEN!<p><b>RANXEROX IN NEW YORK</b><br>Introduction by Richard Corben<br>""It is my great pleasure to introduce this work by Tanino Liberatore and Stefano Tamburini. They have given us a mechanical creature with more passionate violence than any human character I have ever seen in the comic medium. <br>Ranxerox is a punk, futuristic Frankenstein, and with the under-aged Lubna, they are a bizarre Beauty and the Beast. This artist and writer team have turned a dark mirror to the depths of our Id and we see reflected the base part of ourselves that would take what it wants with no compromise, no apology - and woe to the person who would cross us. But it is all done with a black, wry, satyrical sense of humor. Since I feel a close kinship to Liberatore's art, I would like to scratch this surface first. Comic work is primarily a visual medium. It is the pictures, the page design, the graphic concert of the images, scenes, and characters that first attract the reader. Then the art must also be arranged in a conventional way to form a narrative. Some artists put more emphasis on the first task, attraction, while others work harder on the narrative and descriptive elements. <br>I believe I fall into this second category as do most of the comic artists I most admire. Our newest champion is Liberatore. Drawing apparently comes easily to this giant. His skill with anatomical forms is beautiful; yet he is not enslaved to this skill but uses it as a tool to further portray the characters. This guy can really draw flesh-and-blood people. He uses shaded, rounded forms -a rarity in comic art- and he does it with felt-tip markers! The ability to render soft edges with such a tool borders on the supernatural! Ranxerox and Lubna prowl a decayed urban setting with a seething mass of apathetic humanity. All this is rendered with rich textures in a chaotic but fitting color scheme. Ranxerox is a bizarre anti-hero in a twisted, distorted world. There is quite a lot of violence here. Ranx clobbers junkies, thugs, punks, and whole motorcycle gangs. Generally these are nasty characters who get what they deserve. We vicariously cheer Ranx on. But there are a couple of instances that might cause the reader to stop and think, even get angry for a moment: After a psychotic with a gun opens fire in a crowded train, killing several innocent bystanders, none of the survivors is concerned about the victims. And earlier, Ranx is irritated by a little girl selling flowers and he crushes her hand. Is this mindless peripheral violence? This may be an absurdly exaggerated joke about Italian flower girls. Perhaps Tamburini is saying, with Liberatore's help, that innocence has no hope for survival in such a world and the general population consists of automaton-like people who are more like machines than Ranxerox. <br>Finally, despite the artistic complexity, Ranxerox is not to be taken too seriously. Like Punch who threw his baby out the window and constantly beat Judy, Ranx is outrageous, but funny entertainment.""<br>--Richard Corben, June 1984</p>",Heavy Metal,Classic Book,"Classic Books, onsale",false,Variant,Default Title,,,,,"",0,shopify,0,deny,bandwear-fulfillment,8.99,29.95,true,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2358/6005/products/ranx123.jpg?v=1505679880,1,"Liberatore- Ranx <b>Collected #1, 2 & 3</b>",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2358/6005/products/ranx123.jpg?v=1505679880,lb,,

<p>A visceral ride through a bio-punk future where life is cheap and death is the only way out.</p>
<p>Welcome to 2085, the year of the rabbit.</p>
<p>Fluorescent Black takes the reader into the hard-hitting dark future of South East Asia where gene-tech has divided humankind into two races: the rich, healthy Superiors and the sick, crazy Inferiors. These two races live in neighboring cities separated by a heavily fortified border.</p>
<p>A superior named Nina is the test model for cutting edge genetic designs. She is a paragon of physical and mental health: her brain and body represent billions of dollars worth of corporate research and development. During a bio-terrorist attack, Nina is kidnapped by a street gang and taken across the border into a ghetto full of man-made splice animals, psychopathic hookers, drug addled freaks, deadly insects, poisonous ecosystems, and abandoned tenements.</p>
<p>When the corporations tighten their dragnet, the gang quickly discovers that this is no ordinary captive... but she may be the key to solving all of their problems.</p>",Heavy Metal - No Sale,Classic Book,"allowsale, Classic Books, onsale, Signed",true,Variant,Default Title,,,,,BOOKS:FLUORESCENT BLACK SC,680,shopify,647,deny,bandwear-fulfillment,15.00,50.00,true,true,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2358/6005/products/florescent_black.jpg?v=1505679802,1,Fluorescent Black Soft Cover - Signed,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2358/6005/products/florescent_black.jpg?v=1505679802,oz,,

The book is set in a hot desert scenario with a fantastic spaghetti western style. I was actually a bit surprised to read this one because it was funnier than the previous one ""500 Rifles"" which has a much rougher story line, but non the less also very recommendable. If you should happen to like his style I can recommend his other series called ""Aqua Bleu"". Vatine's skill at drawing (and women in particular) is more than just amazing.
